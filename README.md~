CSCI 3308 Final Project - Social Networking Site

Members: Chris Poulton, Chris Gavin, Jean-Paul

The project is to make a social networking site like facebook. Users create an account that can be logged into. Within the site, users then search for friends that they know in real life by their last name. Friend requests can then be sent. If the other person accepts the friend request then the user can see the friend’s profile information along with their wall and has the ability to post things on the wall. Each user can a specific newsfeed that shows all the posts that have be written to their's and friends’ walls.
